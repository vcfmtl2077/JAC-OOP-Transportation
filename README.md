# JAC-OOP-Transportation

The purpose of this assignment is to practice class inheritance, and other Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as constructors, access rights, method overriding, etc. The assignment would also allow you to practice the notion of package creation. This assignment contains two parts. You need to complete Part I to be able to do Part II. You should however handle each part as if it was a separate assignment (i.e. you should not modify Part I after finishing with it; rather create a copy of that part and use it to create Part II. This is needed so that you can finally submit both parts!
